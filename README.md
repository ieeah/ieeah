![a repobanner displaying my nickname, which is ieeah](./header.png)
First of all, i didn't even know it was possible to make a personal README, it feels like I'm on sale and this is the sign showing how good I am as a product, but you know, it takes what it takes!:joy:

Development has always fascinated me, but I did never really approcahed it until september 2021 when I decided to dedicate myself to this world.
I've then signed up at a Web Development Bootcamp, and after it, I did a Java course to learn the basics of the language, and then I landed my first job as a frontend web developer in April 2022! :tada::tada::tada:

My work projects are stored in a Gitlab company account, that's why no contributes are shown up here in Github.

## Training Projects :video_game:
I try in my spare time to work on some side projects to sharpen the blade of my abilities and making my toolbox heavier. :hammer_and_wrench:
### PS: This is going to be the "how to start things and don't finish them" guide in the universe :ok_hand:
- [MineSweeper:](https://github.com/ieeah/Campo-Minato) (Yes, another MineSweeper clone) I started developing this game during my first Bootcamp, I decided doing it in vanillaJS, the game is working, I think it's pretty performant, BUT I'm struggling a lot with adding the "expansion feature" (when you click on a tile with zero bombs in the immediate vicinity it should expand all the close tiles, and recursively doing it for every close "empty tile").
- [Snickerz:](https://github.com/ieeah/snickerz) It's a fake sneakers e-commerce, I basically did only the header but once finished, is gonna be a nice project! :laughing: 
- Memory game: It's still an idea and I haven't started coding it yet, but I've written the roadmap to make it reality, now I just need some more spare time! :disappointed:
- [Starbucks Rewards clone:](https://github.com/ieeah/starbucks-rewards-clone) I don't remember the website where I've got this challenge from, (sorry :pray:) but I did this using HTML - SCSS - VanillaJS. `Edit: I noticed a little bug in the rewards carousel visualization, I'll fix that sooner or later`
- [Carrefour:](https://github.com/ieeah/carrefour-project) We looked at the ["Carrefour - Shop Online"](https://www.carrefour.it/spesa-online/) page to make a kind-of-a-clone for this group project.
- [Deliveboo:](https://github.com/ieeah/deliveboo) Similar to the upper "Carrefour Clone", but more complex and large since this was meant to be the final exercise of the Bootcamp, is a full stack clone website of a food-delivery-platform.
Even though the name it clearly recall Deliveroo, it's just the name, the appareance and functionality aren't comparable. Built with VUE and Laravel 8. `Notice: please don't look at the cleanliness of the code, it's terrible, I already know` :neutral_face:
- [Boolflix:](https://github.com/ieeah/vue-boolflix) `Danger! This website is really ugly to look at!` But was one of the first attempts with using a public API (the IMDb one).
- a bunch of other really small things I don't think they own this place :shit:
