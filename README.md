### Hi there I'm Francesco and this is my readme and is stilla WIPðŸ‘‹
First of all, i didn't even know it was possible to make a personal README, it feels like I'm on sale and this is the sign showing how good I am as a product, but you know, it takes what it takes!:joy:

Development has always fascinated me, but I did never really approcahed it until september 2021 when I decided to dedicate myself to this world.
I've then signed up at a Web Development Bootcamp, and after it, I did a Java course to learn the basics of the language, and then I landed my first job as a frontend web developer in April 2022! :tada::tada::tada:

My work projects are stored in a Gitlab company account, that's why no contributes are shown up here in Github.

## Side Projects :video_game:
I try in my spare time to work on some side projects to sharpen the blade of my abilities and making my toolbox heavier. :hammer_and_wrench:
- [MineSweeper:](https://github.com/ieeah/Campo-Minato) (Yes, another MineSweeper clone) I started developing this game during my first Bootcamp, I decided doing it in vanillaJS, the game is working, I think it's pretty performant, BUT I'm struggling a lot with adding the "expansion feature" (when you click on a tile with zero bombs in the immediate vicinity it should expand all the close tiles, and recursively doing it for every close "empty tile").
